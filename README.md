# probabilistic-appointment-scheduling
This project estimates the probability distribution of appointment durations based on relevant conditions using KDE and finds the optimal start time while balancing the provider and client time tradeoff. Details on the methods can be found in the report Bilateral Weighted Scheduling Optimization with Probabilistic Start Time Estimation.pdf
